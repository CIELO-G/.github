## About
The CIELO-G project aims to significantly reshape the culture of our geoscience community by fostering intentional and natural shifts in our interactions with the broader local community.
Our project sets a precedent for transforming the national geosciences towards excellence through engaging learners from all backgrounds towards greater inclusivity and accessibility.

Central to our effort is Collective Impact, the commitment of a group of actors from different sectors to a common agenda to solve specific problems.

## Program Mission:
To engage the local community and raise awareness of the geosciences while preparing students for careers in geoscience and STEM-related fields.
